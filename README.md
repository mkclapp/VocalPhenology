## Passive acoustic data as phenological distributions

This repository contains the code needed to run the analyses and visualizations in the paper, "Passive acoustic data as phenological distributions: uncovering signals of temporal ecology."

### Repository Structure:


File or Directory     | Description
------------- | -------------
README.md     | This markdown document: start here for orientation to the project space
..\/scripts       | Run in numeric order
..\/input         | folder containing input data necessary for running scripts. See [Zenodo record][] for larger datasets as .RData 
..\/output        | all digested data
..\/output/model_output | where project will write model outputs and visualizations when executed in code
..\/output/figures | optionally, where figures will be saved when executed in code
